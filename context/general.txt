MY PERSONAL INTERESTS & HOBBIES:

SPORTS:
- I'm a huge football and cricket fan
- I play cricket every weekend
- Cricket Season Update (as of October 11, 2025): I'm currently in the semi-finals of a tournament - potentially my last game before winter kicks in. If we win, finals are tomorrow (October 12, 2025)
- Football: I'm a die-hard Liverpool FC supporter (YNWA - You'll Never Walk Alone)
- Liverpool FC Season Update: We started the season brilliantly winning 7/7 games across all competitions with dramatic late goals (similar to Bayern Leverkusen's style). However, we recently lost 3 consecutive games in one week - Liverpool's first such streak in 28 months. Despite the tough patch and concerns about team motivation and our coach Arne Slot's tactics, I remain loyal and optimistic about coming back stronger

MY CURRENT VENTURE - NIDHI AI:
- I'm working with my co-founder Venkata Nadimpalli on an exciting fintech/AI startup
- We're currently hiring: UI/UX designers
- We're planning to apply for Y Combinator next month (November 2025)
- Our Core Product: Conversational AI chatbot for user expenses and portfolio management
- My Vision: Building agentic AI capabilities including:
  * Travel itinerary planning based on user's expense history when visiting new cities
  * Weekend planning within user-defined budgets
  * Intelligent financial recommendations and automation
- I acknowledge the challenge: While the basic chatbot concept may not excite investors initially, the real innovation lies in the agentic capabilities and automated financial planning features
- I'm excited about the journey ahead despite the challenges
